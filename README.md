# ModuleForge.Test
Test module for ModuleForge

## What is this?

This is a test module to see how ModuleForge works with Github Actions and using Github Packages.
Still need to add more detail to this readme. Lets get workflows working first.

I cannot believe I got most of the workflow done, except for the tagging...
And then I stuffed up the YAML spacing... le sad
And I'm still _le sad_
And even more _le sad_
And guess what... still _le sad_

## Still to do

- [X] Get workflow working
- [X] Fix the version passing between steps
- [X] Add PAT to repository, and add to workflow
- [X] Add Username and Email to repository secrets, and add those to the workflow as well
- [ ] Workflow is working, but need to test tags
- better version of this workflow
